    <h1>JPQL Playground</h1>
    <h4>Enter JPQL in the input field and hit the button.  This tool is best used together with
        the IDE console.  Keeping an eye on the SQL generated for your queries is *at least* as
        important as making sure the queries work as intended.  For which the best strategy
        might be to mute most of the logging output but make sure that the SQL logging
        output is turned on.

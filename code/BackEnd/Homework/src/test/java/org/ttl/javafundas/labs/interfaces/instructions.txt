Remember to do your work in the StudentWork module.
Slightly different instructions for this one

The premise of the lab is that you have to create an application
that interacts with a collection of Sensors to collect data about the
environment, e.g. a Temperature Sensor, a Humidity Sensor etc.
Your application needs to periodically ask each of the sensors in
itâ€™s collection to take a reading.

This will require the use of an Interface.

Look in src/test/java/org/ttl/javafundas/labs/interfaces.

The class RunInterfaceLab has a Junit test and some TODO
instructions on what you need to do.

Uncommenting the code will produce a bunch of errors which you
will have to fix.

Don Moye developed his own original 'sun percussion' style of performing, and led [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2601299]Sun Percussion Summit[/url] with [a=Enoch Williamson], which is a group dedicated to exploring the traditions of African-American percussion music.\r\nBorn in Rochester, New York, Famoudou performed in a church choir and various drum and bugle corps (marching ensembles) during his youth. He was exposed to jazz from an early age – his mother worked for a local social club, located door-to-door with a jazz venue that hosted musicians like [a=Kenny Burrell] and [a=Jimmy McGriff], and often took her son to concerts, including [a=Mahalia Jackson] performances. Don Moye's uncles played saxophone, while his father was a drummer.\r\nMoye studied percussion at Wayne State University in Detroit. A trumpeter [a=Charles Moore], who happened to live in the same building, became Famoudou's mentor and introduced him to the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). In 1968, Famoudou Don Moye travelled to Europe with his first band, [b]Detroit Free Jazz[/b]. He eventually spent a few years abroad, working for RAI (Italian Radio and Television) briefly, and collaborating extensively with Moroccan musicians, as well as many notable jazz figures, such as [a=Steve Lacy], [a=Pharoah Sanders], [a=Sonny Sharrock], [a=Randy Weston], and [a=Art Taylor].\r\nIn 1969, while rehearsing and performing at the [l=American Center For Students And Artists] in Paris, Moye met saxophonist [a=Roscoe Mitchell], who was in Europe with his quartet The Art Ensemble of Chicago (also featuring [a=Joseph Jarman] (sax), [a=Lester Bowie] (trumpet) and [a=Malachi Favors] on bass). AEC already released three albums on [l=BYG Records] at the time, but four members were playing percussion parts themselves, and lacked a dedicated performer to complete a rhythm section. Roscoe Mitchell asked Don Moye to join the group.\r\nAfter returning to the United States in the early 1970s, Famoudou Don Moye had played with [a=Black Artists Group] in St. Louis for a while, and finally settled in Chicago. Apart from an extensive work the The Art Ensemble Of Chicago, Moye also played in a duo with percussionist [a=Steve McCall]. In 1984, the musician joined [a=The Leaders (3)] jazz supergroup. Famoudou Don Moye played and recorded with different bands and ensembles of [a=Don Pullen], [a=Cecil McBee], [a=Hamiet Bluiett], [a=Julius A Hemphill], [a=Chico Freeman] and [a=Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy].\r\n",

He eventually spent a few years abroad, working for RAI (Italian Radio and Television) briefly, and collaborating extensively with Moroccan musicians, as well as many notable jazz figures, such as [a=Steve Lacy], [a=Pharoah Sanders], [a=Sonny Sharrock], [a=Randy Weston], and [a=Art Taylor].\r\nIn 1969, while rehearsing and performing at the [l=American Center For Students And Artists] in Paris, Moye met saxophonist [a=Roscoe Mitchell], who was in Europe with his quartet The Art Ensemble of Chicago (also featuring [a=Joseph Jarman] (sax), [a=Lester Bowie] (trumpet) and [a=Malachi Favors] on bass). AEC already released three albums on [l=BYG Records] at the time, but four members were playing percussion parts themselves, and lacked a dedicated performer to complete a rhythm section. Roscoe Mitchell asked Don Moye to join the group.\r\nAfter returning to the United States in the early 1970s, Famoudou Don Moye had played with [a=Black Artists Group] in St. Louis for a while, and finally settled in Chicago. Apart from an extensive work the The Art Ensemble Of Chicago, Moye also played in a duo with percussionist [a=Steve McCall]. In 1984, the musician joined [a=The Leaders (3)] jazz supergroup. Famoudou Don Moye played and recorded with different bands and ensembles of [a=Don Pullen], [a=Cecil McBee], [a=Hamiet Bluiett], [a=Julius A Hemphill], [a=Chico Freeman] and [a=Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy].\r\n",

Don Moye developed his own original 'sun percussion' style of performing, and led [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2601299]Sun Percussion Summit[/url] with [a=Enoch Williamson], which is a group dedicated to exploring the traditions of African-American percussion music.\r\nBorn in Rochester, New York, Famoudou performed in a church choir and various drum and bugle corps (marching ensembles) during his youth. He was exposed to jazz from an early age – his mother worked for a local social club, located door-to-door with a jazz venue that hosted musicians like [a=Kenny Burrell] and [a=Jimmy McGriff], and often took her son to concerts, including [a=Mahalia Jackson] performances. Don Moye's uncles played saxophone, while his father was a drummer.\r\nMoye studied percussion at Wayne State University in Detroit. A trumpeter [a=Charles Moore], who happened to live in the same building, became Famoudou's mentor and introduced him to the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). In 1968, Famoudou Don Moye travelled to Europe with his first band, [b]Detroit Free Jazz[/b]. He eventually spent a few years abroad, working for RAI (Italian Radio and Television) briefly, and collaborating extensively with Moroccan musicians, as well as many notable jazz figures, such as [a=Steve Lacy], [a=Pharoah Sanders], [a=Sonny Sharrock], [a=Randy Weston], and [a=Art Taylor].\r\nIn 1969, while rehearsing and performing at the [l=American Center For Students And Artists] in Paris, Moye met saxophonist [a=Roscoe Mitchell], who was in Europe with his quartet The Art Ensemble of Chicago (also featuring [a=Joseph Jarman] (sax), [a=Lester Bowie] (trumpet) and [a=Malachi Favors] on bass). AEC already released three albums on [l=BYG Records] at the time, but four members were playing percussion parts themselves, and lacked a dedicated performer to complete a rhythm section. Roscoe Mitchell asked Don Moye to join the group.\r\nAfter returning to the United States in the early 1970s, Famoudou Don Moye had played with [a=Black Artists Group] in St. Louis for a while, and finally settled in Chicago. Apart from an extensive work the The Art Ensemble Of Chicago, Moye also played in a duo with percussionist [a=Steve McCall]. In 1984, the musician joined [a=The Leaders (3)] jazz supergroup. Famoudou Don Moye played and recorded with different bands and ensembles of [a=Don Pullen], [a=Cecil McBee], [a=Hamiet Bluiett], [a=Julius A Hemphill], [a=Chico Freeman] and [a=Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy].\r\n",

Don Moye developed his own original 'sun percussion' style of performing, and led [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2601299]Sun Percussion Summit[/url] with [a=Enoch Williamson], which is a group dedicated to exploring the traditions of African-American percussion music.\r\nBorn in Rochester, New York, Famoudou performed in a church choir and various drum and bugle corps (marching ensembles) during his youth. He was exposed to jazz from an early age – his mother worked for a local social club, located door-to-door with a jazz venue that hosted musicians like [a=Kenny Burrell] and [a=Jimmy McGriff], and often took her son to concerts, including [a=Mahalia Jackson] performances. Don Moye's uncles played saxophone, while his father was a drummer.\r\nMoye studied percussion at Wayne State University in Detroit. A trumpeter [a=Charles Moore], who happened to live in the same building, became Famoudou's mentor and introduced him to the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). In 1968, Famoudou Don Moye travelled to Europe with his first band, [b]Detroit Free Jazz[/b]. He eventually spent a few years abroad, working for RAI (Italian Radio and Television) briefly, and collaborating extensively with Moroccan musicians, as well as many notable jazz figures, such as [a=Steve Lacy], [a=Pharoah Sanders], [a=Sonny Sharrock], [a=Randy Weston], and [a=Art Taylor].\r\nIn 1969, while rehearsing and performing at the [l=American Center For Students And Artists] in Paris, Moye met saxophonist [a=Roscoe Mitchell], who was in Europe with his quartet The Art Ensemble of Chicago (also featuring [a=Joseph Jarman] (sax), [a=Lester Bowie] (trumpet) and [a=Malachi Favors] on bass). AEC already released three albums on [l=BYG Records] at the time, but four members were playing percussion parts themselves, and lacked a dedicated performer to complete a rhythm section. Roscoe Mitchell asked Don Moye to join the group.\r\nAfter returning to the United States in the early 1970s, Famoudou Don Moye had played with [a=Black Artists Group] in St. Louis for a while, and finally settled in Chicago. Apart from an extensive work the The Art Ensemble Of Chicago, Moye also played in a duo with percussionist [a=Steve McCall]. In 1984, the musician joined [a=The Leaders (3)] jazz supergroup.

Don Moye developed his own original 'sun percussion' style of performing, and led [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2601299]Sun Percussion Summit[/url] with [a=Enoch Williamson], which is a group dedicated to exploring the traditions of African-American percussion music.\r\nBorn in Rochester, New York, Famoudou performed in a church choir and various drum and bugle corps (marching ensembles) during his youth. He was exposed to jazz from an early age – his mother worked for a local social club, located door-to-door with a jazz venue that hosted musicians like [a=Kenny Burrell] and [a=Jimmy McGriff], and often took her son to concerts, including [a=Mahalia Jackson] performances. Don Moye's uncles played saxophone, while his father was a drummer.\r\nMoye studied percussion at Wayne State University in Detroit. A trumpeter [a=Charles Moore], who happened to live in the same building, became Famoudou's mentor and introduced him to the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). In 1968, Famoudou Don Moye travelled to Europe with his first band, [b]Detroit Free Jazz[/b]. He eventually spent a few years abroad, working for RAI (Italian Radio and Television) briefly, and collaborating extensively with Moroccan musicians, as well as many notable jazz figures, such as [a=Steve Lacy], [a=Pharoah Sanders], [a=Sonny Sharrock], [a=Randy Weston], and [a=Art Taylor].\r\nIn 1969, while rehearsing and performing at the [l=American Center For Students And Artists] in Paris, Moye met saxophonist [a=Roscoe Mitchell], who was in Europe with his quartet The Art Ensemble of Chicago (also featuring [a=Joseph Jarman] (sax), [a=Lester Bowie] (trumpet) and [a=Malachi Favors] on bass). AEC already released three albums on [l=BYG Records] at the time, but four members were playing percussion parts themselves, and lacked a dedicated performer to complete a rhythm section. Roscoe Mitchell asked Don Moye to join the group.\r\nAfter returning to the United States in the early 1970s, Famoudou Don Moye had played with [a=Black Artists Group] in St. Louis for a while, and finally settled in Chicago. Apart from an extensive work the The Art Ensemble Of Chicago, Moye also played in a duo with percussionist [a=Steve McCall]. In 1984, the musician joined [a=The Leaders (3)] jazz supergroup. Famoudou Don Moye played and recorded with different bands and ensembles of [a=Don Pullen], [a=Cecil McBee], [a=Hamiet Bluiett], [a=Julius A Hemphill], [a=Chico Freeman] and [a=Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy].\r\n",

Don Moye developed his own original 'sun percussion' style of performing, and led [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2601299]Sun Percussion Summit[/url] with [a=Enoch Williamson], which is a group dedicated to exploring the traditions of African-American percussion music.\r\nBorn in Rochester, New York, Famoudou performed in a church choir and various drum and bugle corps (marching ensembles) during his youth. He was exposed to jazz from an early age – his mother worked for a local social club, located door-to-door with a jazz venue that hosted musicians like [a=Kenny Burrell] and [a=Jimmy McGriff], and often took her son to concerts, including [a=Mahalia Jackson] performances. Don Moye's uncles played saxophone, while his father was a drummer.\r\nMoye studied percussion at Wayne State University in Detroit. A trumpeter [a=Charles Moore], who happened to live in the same building, became Famoudou's mentor and introduced him to the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). In 1968, Famoudou Don Moye travelled to Europe with his first band, [b]Detroit Free Jazz[/b]. He eventually spent a few years abroad, working for RAI (Italian Radio and Television) briefly, and collaborating extensively with Moroccan musicians, as well as many notable jazz figures, such as [a=Steve Lacy], [a=Pharoah Sanders], [a=Sonny Sharrock], [a=Randy Weston], and [a=Art Taylor].\r\nIn 1969, while rehearsing and performing at the [l=American Center For Students And Artists] in Paris, Moye met saxophonist [a=Roscoe Mitchell], who was in Europe with his quartet The Art Ensemble of Chicago (also featuring [a=Joseph Jarman] (sax), [a=Lester Bowie] (trumpet) and [a=Malachi Favors] on bass). AEC already released three albums on [l=BYG Records] at the time, but four members were playing percussion parts themselves, and lacked a dedicated performer to complete a rhythm section. Roscoe Mitchell asked Don Moye to join the group.\r\nAfter returning to the United States in the early 1970s, Famoudou Don Moye had played with [a=Black Artists Group] in St. Louis for a while, and finally settled in Chicago. Apart from an extensive work the The Art Ensemble Of Chicago, Moye also played in a duo with percussionist [a=Steve McCall]. In 1984, the musician joined [a=The Leaders (3)] jazz supergroup.

Don Moye developed his own original 'sun percussion' style of performing, and led [url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2601299]Sun Percussion Summit[/url] with [a=Enoch Williamson], which is a group dedicated to exploring the traditions of African-American percussion music.\r\nBorn in Rochester, New York, Famoudou performed in a church choir and various drum and bugle corps (marching ensembles) during his youth. He was exposed to jazz from an early age – his mother worked for a local social club, located door-to-door with a jazz venue that hosted musicians like [a=Kenny Burrell] and [a=Jimmy McGriff], and often took her son to concerts, including [a=Mahalia Jackson] performances. Don Moye's uncles played saxophone, while his father was a drummer.\r\nMoye studied percussion at Wayne State University in Detroit. A trumpeter [a=Charles Moore], who happened to live in the same building, became Famoudou's mentor and introduced him to the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians (AACM). In 1968, Famoudou Don Moye travelled to Europe with his first band, [b]Detroit Free Jazz[/b]. He eventually spent a few years abroad, working for RAI (Italian Radio and Television) briefly, and collaborating extensively with Moroccan musicians, as well as many notable jazz figures, such as [a=Steve Lacy], [a=Pharoah Sanders], [a=Sonny Sharrock], [a=Randy Weston], and [a=Art Taylor].\r\nIn 1969, while rehearsing and performing at the [l=American Center For Students And Artists] in Paris, Moye met saxophonist [a=Roscoe Mitchell], who was in Europe with his quartet The Art Ensemble of Chicago (also featuring [a=Joseph Jarman] (sax), [a=Lester Bowie] (trumpet) and [a=Malachi Favors] on bass). AEC already released three albums on [l=BYG Records] at the time, but four members were playing percussion parts themselves, and lacked a dedicated performer to complete a rhythm section. Roscoe Mitchell asked Don Moye to join the group.\r\nAfter returning to the United States in the early 1970s, Famoudou Don Moye had played with [a=Black Artists Group] in St. Louis for a while, and finally settled in Chicago. Apart from an extensive work the The Art Ensemble Of Chicago, Moye also played in a duo with percussionist [a=Steve McCall]. In 1984, the musician joined [a=The Leaders (3)] jazz supergroup. Famoudou Don Moye played and recorded with different bands and ensembles of [a=Don Pullen], [a=Cecil McBee], [a=Hamiet Bluiett], [a=Julius A Hemphill], [a=Chico Freeman] and [a=Lester Bowie's Brass Fantasy].\r\n",

He made his recording debut in 1976 with “On the Track”, which featured legendary jazz violinist Joe Venuti as well as singer/songwriter Don McLean; his 1977 follow-up “Double Time” even reached the U.S. Top 40 charts, largely on the strength of his frequent appearances on television’s Saturday Night Live.\r\n\r\nAfter 1978’s “Champagne Charlie”, Redbone began recording only sporadically; following 1981’s “Branch to Branch”, he waited four years before reentering the studio to cut “Red to Blue”. Invariably, his albums featured guest appearances from an eclectic cast of luminaries: while 1987’s “Christmas Island” included a cameo by Dr. John, 1994’s “Whistling in the Wind” included duets with Ringo Starr and Merle Haggard and 2001’s “Any Time” featured contributions from such jazz luminaries as guitarist Frank Vignola, reedman Ken Peplowski, and bassist Jay Leonhart. Despite his low profile, Redbone has also earned a certain measure of fame as a fixture in various television advertising campaigns.\r\n\r\nIn 2018, Riddle Films released a short documentary about Redbone, called \"Please Don‘t Talk About Me When I’m Gone.\"\r\n",

It was a smashing success. He then worked together with [a=Ray Brown], at first as a duo, before founding in 1952 his first trio which included in succession, the guitarists [a=Irving Ashby], [a=Barney Kessel] and [a=Herb Ellis]. At the end of the 1950s the guitar was replaced by drums. \r\n\r\nPeterson went on many European tours. He has made recordings with just about everybody who's anybody in jazz. \r\n\r\nHis keys touch corresponds to almost explosive ornamentation in phrasing. Despite all the dynamics, a boundless desire for improvisation, a sublime artistic technique, however, the structure of his play (i.e. the over-all conception of harmonic means, phrasing, rhythms, etc.) remains translucent and tight. \r\n",

The Gillespie quintet, which included Haig, recorded four 78 r.p.m. sides for [l=Guild Records] in May 1945 which are regarded as the first recordings to demonstrate all elements of the mature bebop style. He was part of the celebrated nonet on the first session of [a=Miles Davis]' Birth of the Cool. Although Haig became known for his distinctive and pioneering bebop style, he in fact spent much of his career playing in non-jazz contexts. His work was the subject of a revival in the 1970s.\r\n\r\nIn 1969 Haig was acquitted of a murder charge. He had been accused of strangling his third wife, Bonnie, at their home in Clifton, New Jersey on 9 October 1968.

Grange Rutan, Haig's second wife, challenged Haig's account in her 2007 book, Death of a Bebop Wife. Rutan's book is partly autobiographical, partly based on interviews with friends and family members. She describes Bonnie's story in detail, describing an underside to Haig that included a history of serial domestic abuse. Rutan notes that several family members sounded alarm bells regarding Haig's violent personality that went unheeded. Importantly, she quotes bassist [a=Harold Gaylor], who was talking with Haig before a performance at the Edison Hotel lounge in the early seventies, when Haig admitted to him he had caused Bonnie's death.\r\n\r\nIn 1974 Haig was invited to tour Europe by [a=Tony Williams (13)], owner of [l=Spotlite Records] in the UK. At the end of a very successful tour he recorded the 'Invitation' album for Spotlite, with [a=Gilbert Rovère], on bass and [a=Kenny Clarke] on drums.

(Heart attack)\r\n\r\nAl started playing with [a=Dizzy Gillespie] and [a=Charlie Parker] in 1945 [2], and performed and recorded under Gillespie from 1945 to 1946, as a member of [a=Eddie Davis And His Beboppers] in 1946 (also featuring [a=Fats Navarro]), and [a=Eddie Davis And His Quintet] in 1947, under Parker from 1948 to 1950, and under [a=Stan Getz] from 1949 to 1951. The Gillespie quintet, which included Haig, recorded four 78 r.p.m. sides for [l=Guild Records] in May 1945 which are regarded as the first recordings to demonstrate all elements of the mature bebop style. He was part of the celebrated nonet on the first session of [a=Miles Davis]' Birth of the Cool. Although Haig became known for his distinctive and pioneering bebop style, he in fact spent much of his career playing in non-jazz contexts. His work was the subject of a revival in the 1970s.\r\n\r\nIn 1969 Haig was acquitted of a murder charge. He had been accused of strangling his third wife, Bonnie, at their home in Clifton, New Jersey on 9 October 1968. He had said in evidence that his wife had been drunk, and had died in a fall down a flight of stairs. Grange Rutan, Haig's second wife, challenged Haig's account in her 2007 book, Death of a Bebop Wife. Rutan's book is partly autobiographical, partly based on interviews with friends and family members. She describes Bonnie's story in detail, describing an underside to Haig that included a history of serial domestic abuse. Rutan notes that several family members sounded alarm bells regarding Haig's violent personality that went unheeded. Importantly, she quotes bassist [a=Harold Gaylor], who was talking with Haig before a performance at the Edison Hotel lounge in the early seventies, when Haig admitted to him he had caused Bonnie's death.\r\n\r\nIn 1974 Haig was invited to tour Europe by [a=Tony Williams (13)], owner of [l=Spotlite Records] in the UK. At the end of a very successful tour he recorded the 'Invitation' album for Spotlite, with [a=Gilbert Rovère], on bass and [a=Kenny Clarke] on drums. This kick-started his re-emergence and over the next eight years he built a strong following in Europe and toured several times, recording in the UK and France, and appearing elsewhere. He recorded for several Japanese labels",

    "profile" : "American jazz pianist and one of the pioneers of bebop.\r\nBorn :  July 19, 1922 in Newark, New Jersey.\r\nDied :  November 16, 1982 in New York City, New York.  (Heart attack)\r\n\r\nAl started playing with [a=Dizzy Gillespie] and [a=Charlie Parker] in 1945 [2], and performed and recorded under Gillespie from 1945 to 1946, as a member of [a=Eddie Davis And His Beboppers] in 1946 (also featuring [a=Fats Navarro]), and [a=Eddie Davis And His Quintet] in 1947, under Parker from 1948 to 1950, and under [a=Stan Getz] from 1949 to 1951. The Gillespie quintet, which included Haig, recorded four 78 r.p.m. sides for [l=Guild Records] in May 1945 which are regarded as the first recordings to demonstrate all elements of the mature bebop style. He was part of the celebrated nonet on the first session of [a=Miles Davis]' Birth of the Cool. Although Haig became known for his distinctive and pioneering bebop style, he in fact spent much of his career playing in non-jazz contexts. His work was the subject of a revival in the 1970s.\r\n\r\nIn 1969 Haig was acquitted of a murder charge. He had been accused of strangling his third wife, Bonnie, at their home in Clifton, New Jersey on 9 October 1968. He had said in evidence that his wife had been drunk, and had died in a fall down a flight of stairs. Grange Rutan, Haig's second wife, challenged Haig's account in her 2007 book, Death of a Bebop Wife. Rutan's book is partly autobiographical, partly based on interviews with friends and family members. She describes Bonnie's story in detail, describing an underside to Haig that included a history of serial domestic abuse. Rutan notes that several family members sounded alarm bells regarding Haig's violent personality that went unheeded. Importantly, she quotes bassist [a=Harold Gaylor], who was talking with Haig before a performance at the Edison Hotel lounge in the early seventies, when Haig admitted to him he had caused Bonnie's death.\r\n\r\nIn 1974 Haig was invited to tour Europe by [a=Tony Williams (13)], owner of [l=Spotlite Records] in the UK. At the end of a very successful tour he recorded the 'Invitation' album for Spotlite, with [a=Gilbert Rovère], on bass and [a=Kenny Clarke] on drums. This kick-started his re-emergence and over the next eight years he built a strong following in Europe and toured several times, recording in the UK and France, and appearing elsewhere. He recorded for several Japanese labels",

    "profile" : "American keyboardist, pianist, composer, songwriter, arranger, producer, musical director; partner/co-owner of [l=Nineteen Eight Records] (Aug. 2006 - 2013).\r\n\r\nBIO:\r\n\r\nHenry has an innate curiosity and unique ability to bring multiple musical influences together. This is probably because everything from the Beatles to Bach to Count Basie to the sound of Henry’s own father playing various musical instruments could be heard at any time in his Midwest childhood home. \r\n\r\nOne famously curious artist, David Bowie, identified with this spirit in Henry during the making of The Next Day, on which Henry played piano and keyboards. Bowie then chose him as arranger and musical director to help reimagine his classic songs and to shape new ones, creating the sound for what would be Bowie’s final work, Lazarus.\r\n\r\nHenry immerses himself in original projects and creative collaborations expressing his own voice. These works embody his skills as a musical catalyst in every way, from composing, songwriting, and arranging to sound creation, production, and performance. His instrumental group, FORQ, is currently recording and touring worldwide. Other collaborations include the critically acclaimed quartet, Rudder, and Australian synth-pop sensation, Empire of the Sun.\r\n\r\nLegendary producer Phil Ramone felt Henry was essential to the evolution of George Michael’s project Symphonica, both as an arranger and pianist. Michael felt at ease working with Henry and the two enjoyed a successful relationship as Henry went on to be musical director for both the album recording and extensive arena touring. Prior to this, Henry was the musical director and pianist with Rod Stewart and the Great American Songbook. Henry not only led the band on international tours and recorded on several of the songbook albums, but also joined Stewart on many network television appearances. \r\n\r\nHenry is active in the world of film, television, and video games as a composer and orchestrator. His work can be heard in films such as Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Dumb and Dumber To, and many others. Additionally, Henry appears as piano and keyboard player on film soundtracks such as Ocean’s 12, Ocean’s 8, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The 100 Foot Journey, Zoolander 2, The Last Mimzy, and Two Weeks Notice. (IMDB)\r\n\r\nHenry has recorded and toured with diverse artists such as Ariana Grande, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Vanessa Williams, Walter Becker, PM Dawn, Dionne Warwick, Sanne Salomonsen, Chris Barron, Harry Belafonte, Christopher Cross, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Nikka Costa. Henry has also worked with seminal producers such as Tony Visconti, Richard Perry, Steve Tyrell, Jack Douglas, Kevin Killen, and Frank Filipetti. \r\n\r\nHenry’s unique sound can be heard in the world of jazz and improvised music with such luminaries as Donny McCaslin, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Cassandra Wilson, Theo Bleckman, Bill Evans, Till Bronner, Alex Sipiagin, Joe Locke, Bill Bruford, Wayne Krantz, Seamus Blake, Chris Botti, and more. (ALLMUSIC)\r\n\r\nHenry’s other passion is sailing. When not working in music he can be found happily aboard a sloop in the waters off Long Island.\r\n\r\n",

    "profile" : "American keyboardist, pianist, composer, songwriter, arranger, producer, musical director; partner/co-owner of [l=Nineteen Eight Records] (Aug. 2006 - 2013).\r\n\r\nBIO:\r\n\r\nHenry has an innate curiosity and unique ability to bring multiple musical influences together. This is probably because everything from the Beatles to Bach to Count Basie to the sound of Henry’s own father playing various musical instruments could be heard at any time in his Midwest childhood home. \r\n\r\nOne famously curious artist, David Bowie, identified with this spirit in Henry during the making of The Next Day, on which Henry played piano and keyboards. Bowie then chose him as arranger and musical director to help reimagine his classic songs and to shape new ones, creating the sound for what would be Bowie’s final work, Lazarus.\r\n\r\nHenry immerses himself in original projects and creative collaborations expressing his own voice. These works embody his skills as a musical catalyst in every way, from composing, songwriting, and arranging to sound creation, production, and performance. His instrumental group, FORQ, is currently recording and touring worldwide. Other collaborations include the critically acclaimed quartet, Rudder, and Australian synth-pop sensation, Empire of the Sun.\r\n\r\nLegendary producer Phil Ramone felt Henry was essential to the evolution of George Michael’s project Symphonica, both as an arranger and pianist. Michael felt at ease working with Henry and the two enjoyed a successful relationship as Henry went on to be musical director for both the album recording and extensive arena touring. Prior to this, Henry was the musical director and pianist with Rod Stewart and the Great American Songbook. Henry not only led the band on international tours and recorded on several of the songbook albums, but also joined Stewart on many network television appearances. \r\n\r\nHenry is active in the world of film, television, and video games as a composer and orchestrator. His work can be heard in films such as Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Dumb and Dumber To, and many others. Additionally, Henry appears as piano and keyboard player on film soundtracks such as Ocean’s 12, Ocean’s 8, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The 100 Foot Journey, Zoolander 2, The Last Mimzy, and Two Weeks Notice. (IMDB)\r\n\r\nHenry has recorded and toured with diverse artists such as Ariana Grande, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Vanessa Williams, Walter Becker, PM Dawn, Dionne Warwick, Sanne Salomonsen, Chris Barron, Harry Belafonte, Christopher Cross, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Nikka Costa. Henry has also worked with seminal producers such as Tony Visconti, Richard Perry, Steve Tyrell, Jack Douglas, Kevin Killen, and Frank Filipetti. \r\n\r\nHenry’s unique sound can be heard in the world of jazz and improvised music with such luminaries as Donny McCaslin, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Cassandra Wilson, Theo Bleckman, Bill Evans, Till Bronner, Alex Sipiagin, Joe Locke, Bill Bruford, Wayne Krantz, Seamus Blake, Chris Botti, and more. (ALLMUSIC)\r\n\r\nHenry’s other passion is sailing. When not working in music he can be found happily aboard a sloop in the waters off Long Island.\r\n\r\n",

    "profile" : "American keyboardist, pianist, composer, songwriter, arranger, producer, musical director; partner/co-owner of [l=Nineteen Eight Records] (Aug. 2006 - 2013).\r\n\r\nBIO:\r\n\r\nHenry has an innate curiosity and unique ability to bring multiple musical influences together. This is probably because everything from the Beatles to Bach to Count Basie to the sound of Henry’s own father playing various musical instruments could be heard at any time in his Midwest childhood home. \r\n\r\nOne famously curious artist, David Bowie, identified with this spirit in Henry during the making of The Next Day, on which Henry played piano and keyboards. Bowie then chose him as arranger and musical director to help reimagine his classic songs and to shape new ones, creating the sound for what would be Bowie’s final work, Lazarus.\r\n\r\nHenry immerses himself in original projects and creative collaborations expressing his own voice. These works embody his skills as a musical catalyst in every way, from composing, songwriting, and arranging to sound creation, production, and performance. His instrumental group, FORQ, is currently recording and touring worldwide. Other collaborations include the critically acclaimed quartet, Rudder, and Australian synth-pop sensation, Empire of the Sun.\r\n\r\nLegendary producer Phil Ramone felt Henry was essential to the evolution of George Michael’s project Symphonica, both as an arranger and pianist. Michael felt at ease working with Henry and the two enjoyed a successful relationship as Henry went on to be musical director for both the album recording and extensive arena touring. Prior to this, Henry was the musical director and pianist with Rod Stewart and the Great American Songbook. Henry not only led the band on international tours and recorded on several of the songbook albums, but also joined Stewart on many network television appearances. \r\n\r\nHenry is active in the world of film, television, and video games as a composer and orchestrator. His work can be heard in films such as Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Dumb and Dumber To, and many others. Additionally, Henry appears as piano and keyboard player on film soundtracks such as Ocean’s 12, Ocean’s 8, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The 100 Foot Journey, Zoolander 2, The Last Mimzy, and Two Weeks Notice. (IMDB)\r\n\r\nHenry has recorded and toured with diverse artists such as Ariana Grande, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Vanessa Williams, Walter Becker, PM Dawn, Dionne Warwick, Sanne Salomonsen, Chris Barron, Harry Belafonte, Christopher Cross, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Nikka Costa. Henry has also worked with seminal producers such as Tony Visconti, Richard Perry, Steve Tyrell, Jack Douglas, Kevin Killen, and Frank Filipetti. \r\n\r\nHenry’s unique sound can be heard in the world of jazz and improvised music with such luminaries as Donny McCaslin, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Cassandra Wilson, Theo Bleckman, Bill Evans, Till Bronner, Alex Sipiagin, Joe Locke, Bill Bruford, Wayne Krantz, Seamus Blake, Chris Botti, and more. (ALLMUSIC)\r\n\r\nHenry’s other passion is sailing. When not working in music he can be found happily aboard a sloop in the waters off Long Island.\r\n\r\n",

    "profile" : "American keyboardist, pianist, composer, songwriter, arranger, producer, musical director; partner/co-owner of [l=Nineteen Eight Records] (Aug. 2006 - 2013).\r\n\r\nBIO:\r\n\r\nHenry has an innate curiosity and unique ability to bring multiple musical influences together. This is probably because everything from the Beatles to Bach to Count Basie to the sound of Henry’s own father playing various musical instruments could be heard at any time in his Midwest childhood home. \r\n\r\nOne famously curious artist, David Bowie, identified with this spirit in Henry during the making of The Next Day, on which Henry played piano and keyboards. Bowie then chose him as arranger and musical director to help reimagine his classic songs and to shape new ones, creating the sound for what would be Bowie’s final work, Lazarus.\r\n\r\nHenry immerses himself in original projects and creative collaborations expressing his own voice. These works embody his skills as a musical catalyst in every way, from composing, songwriting, and arranging to sound creation, production, and performance. His instrumental group, FORQ, is currently recording and touring worldwide. Other collaborations include the critically acclaimed quartet, Rudder, and Australian synth-pop sensation, Empire of the Sun.\r\n\r\nLegendary producer Phil Ramone felt Henry was essential to the evolution of George Michael’s project Symphonica, both as an arranger and pianist. Michael felt at ease working with Henry and the two enjoyed a successful relationship as Henry went on to be musical director for both the album recording and extensive arena touring. Prior to this, Henry was the musical director and pianist with Rod Stewart and the Great American Songbook. Henry not only led the band on international tours and recorded on several of the songbook albums, but also joined Stewart on many network television appearances. \r\n\r\nHenry is active in the world of film, television, and video games as a composer and orchestrator. His work can be heard in films such as Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Dumb and Dumber To, and many others. Additionally, Henry appears as piano and keyboard player on film soundtracks such as Ocean’s 12, Ocean’s 8, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The 100 Foot Journey, Zoolander 2, The Last Mimzy, and Two Weeks Notice. (IMDB)\r\n\r\nHenry has recorded and toured with diverse artists such as Ariana Grande, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Vanessa Williams, Walter Becker, PM Dawn, Dionne Warwick, Sanne Salomonsen, Chris Barron, Harry Belafonte, Christopher Cross, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Nikka Costa. Henry has also worked with seminal producers such as Tony Visconti, Richard Perry, Steve Tyrell, Jack Douglas, Kevin Killen, and Frank Filipetti. \r\n\r\nHenry’s unique sound can be heard in the world of jazz and improvised music with such luminaries as Donny McCaslin, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Cassandra Wilson, Theo Bleckman, Bill Evans, Till Bronner, Alex Sipiagin, Joe Locke, Bill Bruford, Wayne Krantz, Seamus Blake, Chris Botti, and more. (ALLMUSIC)\r\n\r\nHenry’s other passion is sailing. When not working in music he can be found happily aboard a sloop in the waters off Long Island.\r\n\r\n",

    "profile" : "American keyboardist, pianist, composer, songwriter, arranger, producer, musical director; partner/co-owner of [l=Nineteen Eight Records] (Aug. 2006 - 2013).\r\n\r\nBIO:\r\n\r\nHenry has an innate curiosity and unique ability to bring multiple musical influences together. This is probably because everything from the Beatles to Bach to Count Basie to the sound of Henry’s own father playing various musical instruments could be heard at any time in his Midwest childhood home. \r\n\r\nOne famously curious artist, David Bowie, identified with this spirit in Henry during the making of The Next Day, on which Henry played piano and keyboards. Bowie then chose him as arranger and musical director to help reimagine his classic songs and to shape new ones, creating the sound for what would be Bowie’s final work, Lazarus.\r\n\r\nHenry immerses himself in original projects and creative collaborations expressing his own voice. These works embody his skills as a musical catalyst in every way, from composing, songwriting, and arranging to sound creation, production, and performance. His instrumental group, FORQ, is currently recording and touring worldwide. Other collaborations include the critically acclaimed quartet, Rudder, and Australian synth-pop sensation, Empire of the Sun.\r\n\r\nLegendary producer Phil Ramone felt Henry was essential to the evolution of George Michael’s project Symphonica, both as an arranger and pianist. Michael felt at ease working with Henry and the two enjoyed a successful relationship as Henry went on to be musical director for both the album recording and extensive arena touring. Prior to this, Henry was the musical director and pianist with Rod Stewart and the Great American Songbook. Henry not only led the band on international tours and recorded on several of the songbook albums, but also joined Stewart on many network television appearances. \r\n\r\nHenry is active in the world of film, television, and video games as a composer and orchestrator. His work can be heard in films such as Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Dumb and Dumber To, and many others. Additionally, Henry appears as piano and keyboard player on film soundtracks such as Ocean’s 12, Ocean’s 8, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The 100 Foot Journey, Zoolander 2, The Last Mimzy, and Two Weeks Notice. (IMDB)\r\n\r\nHenry has recorded and toured with diverse artists such as Ariana Grande, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Vanessa Williams, Walter Becker, PM Dawn, Dionne Warwick, Sanne Salomonsen, Chris Barron, Harry Belafonte, Christopher Cross, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Nikka Costa. Henry has also worked with seminal producers such as Tony Visconti, Richard Perry, Steve Tyrell, Jack Douglas, Kevin Killen, and Frank Filipetti. \r\n\r\nHenry’s unique sound can be heard in the world of jazz and improvised music with such luminaries as Donny McCaslin, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Cassandra Wilson, Theo Bleckman, Bill Evans, Till Bronner, Alex Sipiagin, Joe Locke, Bill Bruford, Wayne Krantz, Seamus Blake, Chris Botti, and more. (ALLMUSIC)\r\n\r\nHenry’s other passion is sailing. When not working in music he can be found happily aboard a sloop in the waters off Long Island.\r\n\r\n",

    "profile" : "American keyboardist, pianist, composer, songwriter, arranger, producer, musical director; partner/co-owner of [l=Nineteen Eight Records] (Aug. 2006 - 2013).\r\n\r\nBIO:\r\n\r\nHenry has an innate curiosity and unique ability to bring multiple musical influences together. This is probably because everything from the Beatles to Bach to Count Basie to the sound of Henry’s own father playing various musical instruments could be heard at any time in his Midwest childhood home. \r\n\r\nOne famously curious artist, David Bowie, identified with this spirit in Henry during the making of The Next Day, on which Henry played piano and keyboards. Bowie then chose him as arranger and musical director to help reimagine his classic songs and to shape new ones, creating the sound for what would be Bowie’s final work, Lazarus.\r\n\r\nHenry immerses himself in original projects and creative collaborations expressing his own voice. These works embody his skills as a musical catalyst in every way, from composing, songwriting, and arranging to sound creation, production, and performance. His instrumental group, FORQ, is currently recording and touring worldwide. Other collaborations include the critically acclaimed quartet, Rudder, and Australian synth-pop sensation, Empire of the Sun.\r\n\r\nLegendary producer Phil Ramone felt Henry was essential to the evolution of George Michael’s project Symphonica, both as an arranger and pianist. Michael felt at ease working with Henry and the two enjoyed a successful relationship as Henry went on to be musical director for both the album recording and extensive arena touring. Prior to this, Henry was the musical director and pianist with Rod Stewart and the Great American Songbook. Henry not only led the band on international tours and recorded on several of the songbook albums, but also joined Stewart on many network television appearances. \r\n\r\nHenry is active in the world of film, television, and video games as a composer and orchestrator. His work can be heard in films such as Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Dumb and Dumber To, and many others. Additionally, Henry appears as piano and keyboard player on film soundtracks such as Ocean’s 12, Ocean’s 8, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The 100 Foot Journey, Zoolander 2, The Last Mimzy, and Two Weeks Notice. (IMDB)\r\n\r\nHenry has recorded and toured with diverse artists such as Ariana Grande, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Vanessa Williams, Walter Becker, PM Dawn, Dionne Warwick, Sanne Salomonsen, Chris Barron, Harry Belafonte, Christopher Cross, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Nikka Costa. Henry has also worked with seminal producers such as Tony Visconti, Richard Perry, Steve Tyrell, Jack Douglas, Kevin Killen, and Frank Filipetti. \r\n\r\nHenry’s unique sound can be heard in the world of jazz and improvised music with such luminaries as Donny McCaslin, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Cassandra Wilson, Theo Bleckman, Bill Evans, Till Bronner, Alex Sipiagin, Joe Locke, Bill Bruford, Wayne Krantz, Seamus Blake, Chris Botti, and more. (ALLMUSIC)\r\n\r\nHenry’s other passion is sailing. When not working in music he can be found happily aboard a sloop in the waters off Long Island.\r\n\r\n",

    "profile" : "American keyboardist, pianist, composer, songwriter, arranger, producer, musical director; partner/co-owner of [l=Nineteen Eight Records] (Aug. 2006 - 2013).\r\n\r\nBIO:\r\n\r\nHenry has an innate curiosity and unique ability to bring multiple musical influences together. This is probably because everything from the Beatles to Bach to Count Basie to the sound of Henry’s own father playing various musical instruments could be heard at any time in his Midwest childhood home. \r\n\r\nOne famously curious artist, David Bowie, identified with this spirit in Henry during the making of The Next Day, on which Henry played piano and keyboards. Bowie then chose him as arranger and musical director to help reimagine his classic songs and to shape new ones, creating the sound for what would be Bowie’s final work, Lazarus.\r\n\r\nHenry immerses himself in original projects and creative collaborations expressing his own voice. These works embody his skills as a musical catalyst in every way, from composing, songwriting, and arranging to sound creation, production, and performance. His instrumental group, FORQ, is currently recording and touring worldwide. Other collaborations include the critically acclaimed quartet, Rudder, and Australian synth-pop sensation, Empire of the Sun.\r\n\r\nLegendary producer Phil Ramone felt Henry was essential to the evolution of George Michael’s project Symphonica, both as an arranger and pianist. Michael felt at ease working with Henry and the two enjoyed a successful relationship as Henry went on to be musical director for both the album recording and extensive arena touring. Prior to this, Henry was the musical director and pianist with Rod Stewart and the Great American Songbook. Henry not only led the band on international tours and recorded on several of the songbook albums, but also joined Stewart on many network television appearances. \r\n\r\nHenry is active in the world of film, television, and video games as a composer and orchestrator. His work can be heard in films such as Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Dumb and Dumber To, and many others. Additionally, Henry appears as piano and keyboard player on film soundtracks such as Ocean’s 12, Ocean’s 8, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The 100 Foot Journey, Zoolander 2, The Last Mimzy, and Two Weeks Notice. (IMDB)\r\n\r\nHenry has recorded and toured with diverse artists such as Ariana Grande, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Vanessa Williams, Walter Becker, PM Dawn, Dionne Warwick, Sanne Salomonsen, Chris Barron, Harry Belafonte, Christopher Cross, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Nikka Costa. Henry has also worked with seminal producers such as Tony Visconti, Richard Perry, Steve Tyrell, Jack Douglas, Kevin Killen, and Frank Filipetti. \r\n\r\nHenry’s unique sound can be heard in the world of jazz and improvised music with such luminaries as Donny McCaslin, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Cassandra Wilson, Theo Bleckman, Bill Evans, Till Bronner, Alex Sipiagin, Joe Locke, Bill Bruford, Wayne Krantz, Seamus Blake, Chris Botti, and more. (ALLMUSIC)\r\n\r\nHenry’s other passion is sailing. When not working in music he can be found happily aboard a sloop in the waters off Long Island.\r\n\r\n",

    "profile" : "American keyboardist, pianist, composer, songwriter, arranger, producer, musical director; partner/co-owner of [l=Nineteen Eight Records] (Aug. 2006 - 2013).\r\n\r\nBIO:\r\n\r\nHenry has an innate curiosity and unique ability to bring multiple musical influences together. This is probably because everything from the Beatles to Bach to Count Basie to the sound of Henry’s own father playing various musical instruments could be heard at any time in his Midwest childhood home. \r\n\r\nOne famously curious artist, David Bowie, identified with this spirit in Henry during the making of The Next Day, on which Henry played piano and keyboards. Bowie then chose him as arranger and musical director to help reimagine his classic songs and to shape new ones, creating the sound for what would be Bowie’s final work, Lazarus.\r\n\r\nHenry immerses himself in original projects and creative collaborations expressing his own voice. These works embody his skills as a musical catalyst in every way, from composing, songwriting, and arranging to sound creation, production, and performance. His instrumental group, FORQ, is currently recording and touring worldwide. Other collaborations include the critically acclaimed quartet, Rudder, and Australian synth-pop sensation, Empire of the Sun.\r\n\r\nLegendary producer Phil Ramone felt Henry was essential to the evolution of George Michael’s project Symphonica, both as an arranger and pianist. Michael felt at ease working with Henry and the two enjoyed a successful relationship as Henry went on to be musical director for both the album recording and extensive arena touring. Prior to this, Henry was the musical director and pianist with Rod Stewart and the Great American Songbook. Henry not only led the band on international tours and recorded on several of the songbook albums, but also joined Stewart on many network television appearances. \r\n\r\nHenry is active in the world of film, television, and video games as a composer and orchestrator. His work can be heard in films such as Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Dumb and Dumber To, and many others. Additionally, Henry appears as piano and keyboard player on film soundtracks such as Ocean’s 12, Ocean’s 8, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The 100 Foot Journey, Zoolander 2, The Last Mimzy, and Two Weeks Notice. (IMDB)\r\n\r\nHenry has recorded and toured with diverse artists such as Ariana Grande, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Vanessa Williams, Walter Becker, PM Dawn, Dionne Warwick, Sanne Salomonsen, Chris Barron, Harry Belafonte, Christopher Cross, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Nikka Costa. Henry has also worked with seminal producers such as Tony Visconti, Richard Perry, Steve Tyrell, Jack Douglas, Kevin Killen, and Frank Filipetti. \r\n\r\nHenry’s unique sound can be heard in the world of jazz and improvised music with such luminaries as Donny McCaslin, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Cassandra Wilson, Theo Bleckman, Bill Evans, Till Bronner, Alex Sipiagin, Joe Locke, Bill Bruford, Wayne Krantz, Seamus Blake, Chris Botti, and more. (ALLMUSIC)\r\n\r\nHenry’s other passion is sailing. When not working in music he can be found happily aboard a sloop in the waters off Long Island.\r\n\r\n",

    "profile" : "American keyboardist, pianist, composer, songwriter, arranger, producer, musical director; partner/co-owner of [l=Nineteen Eight Records] (Aug. 2006 - 2013).\r\n\r\nBIO:\r\n\r\nHenry has an innate curiosity and unique ability to bring multiple musical influences together. This is probably because everything from the Beatles to Bach to Count Basie to the sound of Henry’s own father playing various musical instruments could be heard at any time in his Midwest childhood home. \r\n\r\nOne famously curious artist, David Bowie, identified with this spirit in Henry during the making of The Next Day, on which Henry played piano and keyboards. Bowie then chose him as arranger and musical director to help reimagine his classic songs and to shape new ones, creating the sound for what would be Bowie’s final work, Lazarus.\r\n\r\nHenry immerses himself in original projects and creative collaborations expressing his own voice. These works embody his skills as a musical catalyst in every way, from composing, songwriting, and arranging to sound creation, production, and performance. His instrumental group, FORQ, is currently recording and touring worldwide. Other collaborations include the critically acclaimed quartet, Rudder, and Australian synth-pop sensation, Empire of the Sun.\r\n\r\nLegendary producer Phil Ramone felt Henry was essential to the evolution of George Michael’s project Symphonica, both as an arranger and pianist. Michael felt at ease working with Henry and the two enjoyed a successful relationship as Henry went on to be musical director for both the album recording and extensive arena touring. Prior to this, Henry was the musical director and pianist with Rod Stewart and the Great American Songbook. Henry not only led the band on international tours and recorded on several of the songbook albums, but also joined Stewart on many network television appearances. \r\n\r\nHenry is active in the world of film, television, and video games as a composer and orchestrator. His work can be heard in films such as Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Dumb and Dumber To, and many others. Additionally, Henry appears as piano and keyboard player on film soundtracks such as Ocean’s 12, Ocean’s 8, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The 100 Foot Journey, Zoolander 2, The Last Mimzy, and Two Weeks Notice. (IMDB)\r\n\r\nHenry has recorded and toured with diverse artists such as Ariana Grande, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Vanessa Williams, Walter Becker, PM Dawn, Dionne Warwick, Sanne Salomonsen, Chris Barron, Harry Belafonte, Christopher Cross, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Nikka Costa. Henry has also worked with seminal producers such as Tony Visconti, Richard Perry, Steve Tyrell, Jack Douglas, Kevin Killen, and Frank Filipetti. \r\n\r\nHenry’s unique sound can be heard in the world of jazz and improvised music with such luminaries as Donny McCaslin, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Cassandra Wilson, Theo Bleckman, Bill Evans, Till Bronner, Alex Sipiagin, Joe Locke, Bill Bruford, Wayne Krantz, Seamus Blake, Chris Botti, and more. (ALLMUSIC)\r\n\r\nHenry’s other passion is sailing. When not working in music he can be found happily aboard a sloop in the waters off Long Island.\r\n\r\n",

    "profile" : "American keyboardist, pianist, composer, songwriter, arranger, producer, musical director; partner/co-owner of [l=Nineteen Eight Records] (Aug. 2006 - 2013).\r\n\r\nBIO:\r\n\r\nHenry has an innate curiosity and unique ability to bring multiple musical influences together. This is probably because everything from the Beatles to Bach to Count Basie to the sound of Henry’s own father playing various musical instruments could be heard at any time in his Midwest childhood home. \r\n\r\nOne famously curious artist, David Bowie, identified with this spirit in Henry during the making of The Next Day, on which Henry played piano and keyboards. Bowie then chose him as arranger and musical director to help reimagine his classic songs and to shape new ones, creating the sound for what would be Bowie’s final work, Lazarus.\r\n\r\nHenry immerses himself in original projects and creative collaborations expressing his own voice. These works embody his skills as a musical catalyst in every way, from composing, songwriting, and arranging to sound creation, production, and performance. His instrumental group, FORQ, is currently recording and touring worldwide. Other collaborations include the critically acclaimed quartet, Rudder, and Australian synth-pop sensation, Empire of the Sun.\r\n\r\nLegendary producer Phil Ramone felt Henry was essential to the evolution of George Michael’s project Symphonica, both as an arranger and pianist. Michael felt at ease working with Henry and the two enjoyed a successful relationship as Henry went on to be musical director for both the album recording and extensive arena touring. Prior to this, Henry was the musical director and pianist with Rod Stewart and the Great American Songbook. Henry not only led the band on international tours and recorded on several of the songbook albums, but also joined Stewart on many network television appearances. \r\n\r\nHenry is active in the world of film, television, and video games as a composer and orchestrator. His work can be heard in films such as Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Dumb and Dumber To, and many others. Additionally, Henry appears as piano and keyboard player on film soundtracks such as Ocean’s 12, Ocean’s 8, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The 100 Foot Journey, Zoolander 2, The Last Mimzy, and Two Weeks Notice. (IMDB)\r\n\r\nHenry has recorded and toured with diverse artists such as Ariana Grande, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Vanessa Williams, Walter Becker, PM Dawn, Dionne Warwick, Sanne Salomonsen, Chris Barron, Harry Belafonte, Christopher Cross, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Nikka Costa. Henry has also worked with seminal producers such as Tony Visconti, Richard Perry, Steve Tyrell, Jack Douglas, Kevin Killen, and Frank Filipetti. \r\n\r\nHenry’s unique sound can be heard in the world of jazz and improvised music with such luminaries as Donny McCaslin, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Cassandra Wilson, Theo Bleckman, Bill Evans, Till Bronner, Alex Sipiagin, Joe Locke, Bill Bruford, Wayne Krantz, Seamus Blake, Chris Botti, and more. (ALLMUSIC)\r\n\r\nHenry’s other passion is sailing. When not working in music he can be found happily aboard a sloop in the waters off Long Island.\r\n\r\n",

    "profile" : "American keyboardist, pianist, composer, songwriter, arranger, producer, musical director; partner/co-owner of [l=Nineteen Eight Records] (Aug. 2006 - 2013).\r\n\r\nBIO:\r\n\r\nHenry has an innate curiosity and unique ability to bring multiple musical influences together. This is probably because everything from the Beatles to Bach to Count Basie to the sound of Henry’s own father playing various musical instruments could be heard at any time in his Midwest childhood home. \r\n\r\nOne famously curious artist, David Bowie, identified with this spirit in Henry during the making of The Next Day, on which Henry played piano and keyboards. Bowie then chose him as arranger and musical director to help reimagine his classic songs and to shape new ones, creating the sound for what would be Bowie’s final work, Lazarus.\r\n\r\nHenry immerses himself in original projects and creative collaborations expressing his own voice. These works embody his skills as a musical catalyst in every way, from composing, songwriting, and arranging to sound creation, production, and performance. His instrumental group, FORQ, is currently recording and touring worldwide. Other collaborations include the critically acclaimed quartet, Rudder, and Australian synth-pop sensation, Empire of the Sun.\r\n\r\nLegendary producer Phil Ramone felt Henry was essential to the evolution of George Michael’s project Symphonica, both as an arranger and pianist. Michael felt at ease working with Henry and the two enjoyed a successful relationship as Henry went on to be musical director for both the album recording and extensive arena touring. Prior to this, Henry was the musical director and pianist with Rod Stewart and the Great American Songbook. Henry not only led the band on international tours and recorded on several of the songbook albums, but also joined Stewart on many network television appearances. \r\n\r\nHenry is active in the world of film, television, and video games as a composer and orchestrator. His work can be heard in films such as Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Dumb and Dumber To, and many others. Additionally, Henry appears as piano and keyboard player on film soundtracks such as Ocean’s 12, Ocean’s 8, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The 100 Foot Journey, Zoolander 2, The Last Mimzy, and Two Weeks Notice. (IMDB)\r\n\r\nHenry has recorded and toured with diverse artists such as Ariana Grande, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Vanessa Williams, Walter Becker, PM Dawn, Dionne Warwick, Sanne Salomonsen, Chris Barron, Harry Belafonte, Christopher Cross, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Nikka Costa. Henry has also worked with seminal producers such as Tony Visconti, Richard Perry, Steve Tyrell, Jack Douglas, Kevin Killen, and Frank Filipetti. \r\n\r\nHenry’s unique sound can be heard in the world of jazz and improvised music with such luminaries as Donny McCaslin, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Cassandra Wilson, Theo Bleckman, Bill Evans, Till Bronner, Alex Sipiagin, Joe Locke, Bill Bruford, Wayne Krantz, Seamus Blake, Chris Botti, and more. (ALLMUSIC)\r\n\r\nHenry’s other passion is sailing. When not working in music he can be found happily aboard a sloop in the waters off Long Island.\r\n\r\n",

    "profile" : "American keyboardist, pianist, composer, songwriter, arranger, producer, musical director; partner/co-owner of [l=Nineteen Eight Records] (Aug. 2006 - 2013).\r\n\r\nBIO:\r\n\r\nHenry has an innate curiosity and unique ability to bring multiple musical influences together. This is probably because everything from the Beatles to Bach to Count Basie to the sound of Henry’s own father playing various musical instruments could be heard at any time in his Midwest childhood home. \r\n\r\nOne famously curious artist, David Bowie, identified with this spirit in Henry during the making of The Next Day, on which Henry played piano and keyboards. Bowie then chose him as arranger and musical director to help reimagine his classic songs and to shape new ones, creating the sound for what would be Bowie’s final work, Lazarus.\r\n\r\nHenry immerses himself in original projects and creative collaborations expressing his own voice. These works embody his skills as a musical catalyst in every way, from composing, songwriting, and arranging to sound creation, production, and performance. His instrumental group, FORQ, is currently recording and touring worldwide. Other collaborations include the critically acclaimed quartet, Rudder, and Australian synth-pop sensation, Empire of the Sun.\r\n\r\nLegendary producer Phil Ramone felt Henry was essential to the evolution of George Michael’s project Symphonica, both as an arranger and pianist. Michael felt at ease working with Henry and the two enjoyed a successful relationship as Henry went on to be musical director for both the album recording and extensive arena touring. Prior to this, Henry was the musical director and pianist with Rod Stewart and the Great American Songbook. Henry not only led the band on international tours and recorded on several of the songbook albums, but also joined Stewart on many network television appearances. \r\n\r\nHenry is active in the world of film, television, and video games as a composer and orchestrator. His work can be heard in films such as Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle, Dumb and Dumber To, and many others. Additionally, Henry appears as piano and keyboard player on film soundtracks such as Ocean’s 12, Ocean’s 8, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, The 100 Foot Journey, Zoolander 2, The Last Mimzy, and Two Weeks Notice. (IMDB)\r\n\r\nHenry has recorded and toured with diverse artists such as Ariana Grande, Tedeschi Trucks Band, Vanessa Williams, Walter Becker, PM Dawn, Dionne Warwick, Sanne Salomonsen, Chris Barron, Harry Belafonte, Christopher Cross, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Nikka Costa. Henry has also worked with seminal producers such as Tony Visconti, Richard Perry, Steve Tyrell, Jack Douglas, Kevin Killen, and Frank Filipetti. \r\n\r\nHenry’s unique sound can be heard in the world of jazz and improvised music with such luminaries as Donny McCaslin, Jeff ‘Tain’ Watts, Cassandra Wilson, Theo Bleckman, Bill Evans, Till Bronner, Alex Sipiagin, Joe Locke, Bill Bruford, Wayne Krantz, Seamus Blake, Chris Botti, and more. (ALLMUSIC)\r\n\r\nHenry’s other passion is sailing. When not working in music he can be found happily aboard a sloop in the waters off Long Island.\r\n\r\n",

Following Thompson's departure in April 1978, the group was renamed [a28972]. The first Cure-related release to feature Thompson was the 1979 [a313293] single [m=43984]. Thompson rejoined The Cure in 1984, playing guitar, saxophone and keyboards, and remained a member until 1993. During this period the band's popularity steadily increased, and they released the studio albums [m=21069] (1984), [m=22309] (1985), [m=22500] (1987), [m=31755] (their biggest-selling album) (1989), and [m=32019] (1992).\r\n\r\nIn 1991 Thompson contributed dulcimer to [a517054]'s [m=366207] album, which also featured former Cure drummer [a=Boris Williams]. In 1994 he played on [m=90611], and toured with Page and Plant in 1995–96. He also contributed to [a27458]'s project [a=Babacar (2)].\r\n\r\nThompson joined The Cure for a third time in 2005, and contributed to the studio album [m=32255] (2008). Following his departure in 2011, he legally changed his Christian name to Pearl. Since then he has worked mainly as a visual artist.\r\n\r\nAs half of [a1831977] (with designer [a2044271]), Thompson also created many of The Cure's record covers, from 1983 to 1992, and again from 2004 to 2008. \r\n\r\nHe married Robert Smith's sister, [a1144914], in 1990.
